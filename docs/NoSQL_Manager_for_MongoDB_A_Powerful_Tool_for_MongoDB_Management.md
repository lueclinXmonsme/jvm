# NoSQL Manager for MongoDB: A Powerful Tool for MongoDB Management
 
MongoDB is a popular open-source document database that offers high performance, scalability, and flexibility. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use the traditional relational model of tables, rows, and columns. Instead, MongoDB stores data as documents, which are JSON-like objects that can have different fields and structures. This allows MongoDB to handle complex and dynamic data with ease.
